# SyntaxTree

This code atempts to make basic syntax trees in the Xcode console. It is designed to roughly follow basic **X-Bar theory**.

### Overview of X-Bar theory
– All phrases have a head (X), a bar level (X′), and a phrasal level (XP)  
XP -> X' -> X  

– Specifier: sister of X′, daughter of XP  
XP -> Spec X' 

– Adjunct: sister and daughter of X′  
X' -> Adjunct X' 

– Complement: sister of X, daughter of X′  
X' -> X Complement
